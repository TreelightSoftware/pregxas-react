# Pregxas React App

Pregxas is an open-source community-based prayer management system. There is the main Pregxas application, hosted by Treelight Software, but you are free to take the server and applications (or build your own clients!) and use it to keep track of prayer plans, prayer requests, and more for your group, regardless of faith or background. The application assumes it is the host with smaller communities within the site. If you don't want to host your own server, you may signup for a free or paid hosted version with us!

*What does pregxas mean?*

Pregxas (preh-jas) is a verb from Esperanto which means to pray in the present tense. For example, "mi pregxas" (I pray), "ni pregxas" (we pray).

## Server

This application is fairly useless without a running API. You can see the server-side code at the GitHub repository located [here](https://github.com/TreelightSoftware/pregxas-api).

## Status

This project is in an early-access status and should not be used while under active development. It is a work in progress, with many features missing, lack of tests, and inconsistent code styles. Prior to production-ready release, these will be cleaned up. Pull requests welcome!

## Technologies

We use Create React App and Typescript as the toolchain for this app. Refer to `package.json` for a list of direct dependencies.
